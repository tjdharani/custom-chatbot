United States
The United States of America (U.S.A. or USA), commonly
known as the United States (U.S. or US) or America, is a
country primarily located in North America and consisting of 50
states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, nine
Minor Outlying Islands,
[i] and 326 Indian reservations. It is the
world's third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] It shares
land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south
and has maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and
other nations.
[j] With a population of over 333 million,[k] it is the
most populous country in the Americas and the third-most
populous in the world. The national capital of the United States is
Washington, D.C., and its most populous city and principal
financial center is New York City.
Indigenous peoples have inhabited the Americas for thousands of
years. Beginning in 1607, British colonization led to the
establishment of the Thirteen Colonies in what is now the Eastern
United States. Their quarrel with the British Crown over taxation
and political representation led to the American Revolution and the
ensuing Revolutionary War. The United States declared
independence on July 4, 1776, becoming the first nation-state
founded on Enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights,
consent of the governed, and liberal democracy. The country began
expanding across North America, spanning the continent by 1848.
Sectional division over slavery led to the secession of the
Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of
the Union during the American Civil War (1861–1865). With the
Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally.
By 1890, the United States had established itself as a great power,
becoming the world's largest economy. After Japan's attack on Pearl
Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II on the side of the
Allies. The aftermath of the war left the United States and the Soviet
Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War.
During the Cold War, both countries engaged in a struggle for
ideological dominance but avoided direct military conflict. They
also competed in the Space Race, which culminated in the 1969
landing of Apollo 11, making the U.S. the only nation to land
humans on the Moon. With the Soviet Union's collapse and the
subsequent end of the Cold War in 1991, the United States emerged
as the world's sole superpower.
The United States government is a federal republic and a
representative democracy with three separate branches of
government: executive, legislative, and judicial. It has a bicameral
national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a
lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house
based on equal representation for each state. Many policy issues are
decentralized at a state or local level, with widely differing laws by
jurisdiction. The U.S. ranks highly in international measures of
quality of life, income and wealth, economic competitiveness,
human rights, innovation, and education; it has low levels of
perceived corruption. It has higher levels of incarceration and
inequality than most other liberal democracies, and is the only
liberal democracy without universal healthcare. As a melting pot of
cultures and ethnicities, the U.S. has been drastically shaped by the
world's largest immigrant population.
The United States is a highly developed country that has one of the
highest median incomes of any polity in the world. Its economy
accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP and is the

The first documentary evidence of the phrase "United States of
America" dates back to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by
Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George
Washington, to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp. Moylan
expressed his desire to go "with full and ample powers from the
United States of America to Spain" to seek assistance in the
Revolutionary War effort.[26][27][28] The first known publication of
the phrase "United States of America" was in an anonymous essay
in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, on April  6,
1776.[29]
By June 1776, the name "United States of America" appeared in
drafts of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union,
authored by John Dickinson, a Founding Father from the Province
of Pennsylvania,
[30][31] and in the Declaration of Independence,
written primarily by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Second
Continental Congress in Philadelphia, on July 4, 1776.[30]
The first inhabitants of North
America migrated from Siberia,
crossing the Bering land bridge
and arriving in the present-day
United States at least 12 000
years ago; some evidence
suggests an even earlier date of
arrival.[32][33][34] The Clovis
culture, which appeared around
11 000 BC, is believed to
represent the first wave of
human settlement in the
Americas.
[35][36] This was likely
the first of three major waves of migration into North America; later
waves brought the ancestors of present-day Athabaskans, Aleuts,
and Eskimos.
[37]
Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly
sophisticated, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian
culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture,
architecture, and complex societies.[38] The city-state of Cahokia
was the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in
present-day United States.[39] In the Four Corners region in
present-day Southwestern United States, the culture of Ancestral
Puebloans developed over centuries of agricultural
experimentation.[40] The Algonquian, consisting of peoples who
speak Algonquian languages, were one of the most populous and
widespread North American indigenous peoples.
[41] These people
were historically prominent along the Atlantic Coast and in the
Saint Lawrence River and Great Lakes regions. Before European
immigrants made contact, most of the Algonquian relied on hunting

and fishing, and many supplemented their diet by cultivating corn,
beans, and squash, known as the "Three Sisters". By European
contact in the 17th century, they practiced slash and burn
agriculture, using controlled fire to extend farmlands' productivity
and manage land.[42][43][44][45][46][47] The Ojibwe cultivated wild
rice.
[48] The Iroquois confederation Haudenosaunee, located in the
southern Great Lakes region, was established between the 12th and
15th centuries.[49]
Estimating the native population of North America following the
arrival of European immigrants is difficult.[50][51] Douglas H.
Ubelaker of the Smithsonian Institution estimated a population of
93 000 in the South Atlantic states and a population of 473 000 in
the Gulf states,[52] but most academics regard this figure as too
low.[50] Anthropologist Henry F. Dobyns believed the populations
were much higher, suggesting that approximately 1.1 million
resided on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, 2.2 million people
living between Florida and Massachusetts, 5.2 million in the
Mississippi Valley and tributaries, and around 700 000 in the
Florida peninsula.
[50][51]
The Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, sent by France to the
New World in 1525, encountered Native American inhabitants in
the present-day New York Bay region.[53] The Spanish Empire set
up their first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, including in
Saint Augustine, which is often considered the nation's oldest
city,[54] and Santa Fe. The French established their own settlements
along the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico, including in New
Orleans and Mobile.
[55]
British colonization of the east coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in
1607, where Pilgrims settled in Jamestown and later established Plymouth Colony in
1620.[56][57]
The continent's first elected legislative assembly, the House of Burgesses in Virginia, was
founded in 1619. In 1636, Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts Bay Colony was
founded as the first institution of higher education. The Mayflower Compact and the
Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative selfgovernment and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American
colonies.[58][59] Many English settlers were dissenting Christians who fled England
seeking religious freedom. The native population of America declined after European
arrival,[60][61][62] primarily as a result of infectious diseases such as smallpox and
measles.
[63][64] By the mid-1670s, the British defeated and seized the territory of Dutch
settlers in New Netherland, in the mid-Atlantic region.
In the 17th century, during European colonization, many European settlers experienced
food shortages, disease, and conflicts with Native Americans, including in King Philip's
War. In addition to fighting European settlers, Native Americans also often fought
neighboring tribes. But in many cases, the natives and settlers came to develop a mutual dependency. Settlers traded for food
and animal pelts, and Native Americans traded for guns, tools, and other European goods.[65] Native Americans taught many
settlers to cultivate corn, beans, and other foodstuffs. European missionaries and others felt it was important to "civilize" the
Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural practices and lifestyles.[66][67] With the increased
European colonization of North America, however, Native Americans were often displaced or killed during conflicts.[68]
European settlers also began trafficking African slaves into the colonial United States via the transatlantic slave trade.
[69] By
the turn of the 18th century, slavery supplanted indentured servitude as the main source of agricultural labor for the cash
crops in the American South.
[70] Colonial society was divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery, and
several colonies passed acts for or against it.[71][72]
In what was then considered British America, the Thirteen Colonies[l] were administered as overseas dependencies by the
British.[73] All colonies had local governments with elections open to white male property owners except Jews and, in some
areas, Catholics.
[74][75] With very high birth rates, low death rates, and steadily growing settlements, the colonial population

A map of the territorial acquisitions

grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations.[76] The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s, known as
the Great Awakening, fueled colonial interest in both religion and religious liberty.
[77] Excluding the Native American
population, the Thirteen Colonies had a population of over 2.1  million in 1770, representing a population that was then
roughly a third the size of Britain. By the 1770s, despite continuing new immigrant arrivals from Britain and other European
regions, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[78]
The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed for the development of self-governance in the colonies, but it encountered
periodic efforts by British monarchs to reassert royal authority.[79]
After the British victory in the French and Indian War that was won largely through the
support in men and materiel from the colonies, the British began to assert greater control
in local colonial affairs, fomenting colonial political resistance. In 1774, to demonstrate
colonial dissatisfaction with the lack of representation in the British government that
extracted taxes from them, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia and
passed the Continental Association, which mandated a colonies-wide boycott of British
goods. The American Revolutionary War began the following year, on April 19, 1775, at
the Battles of Lexington and Concord. The colonies responded by again convening in
Philadelphia in the Second Continental Congress, where, in June 1775, they appointed
George Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, which was initially
comprised of various American patriot militias resisting the British Army. In June 1776,
the Second Continental Congress charged a committee with writing a Declaration of
Independence, largely drafted by Thomas Jefferson.
On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress with alterations unanimously adopted
and issued the Declaration of Independence, which famously stated: "We hold these
truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the
pursuit of Happiness." The adoption of the Declaration of Independence is celebrated
annually on July 4 in the United States as Independence Day.
[80] In 1777, the American
victory at the Battle of Saratoga resulted in the capture of a British army, and led to
France and their ally Spain joining in the war against them. After the surrender of a
second British Army at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty.
American sovereignty gained international recognition, and the new nation took
possession of substantial territory east of the Mississippi River, from what is present-day
Canada in the north and Florida in the south.[81] Tensions with Britain remained, leading
to the War of 1812, which was fought to a draw.[82]
In 1781, the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union established a decentralized
government that operated until 1789.[80] Considered one of the most important legislative acts of the Confederation
Congress,
[83] Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the national government would be sovereign
and expand westward with the admission of new states, rather than with the expansion of existing states and their
established sovereignty under the Articles. The prohibition of slavery in the territory had the practical effect of establishing
the Ohio River as the geographic divide between slave states and free states from the Appalachian Mountains to the
Mississippi River, an extension of the Mason–Dixon line. It also helped set the stage for later federal political conflicts over
slavery during the 19th century until the American Civil War.
As it became increasingly apparent that the Confederation was insufficient to govern the new country, nationalists advocated
for and led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, where the United States Constitution was authored and ratified in state
conventions in 1788. The U.S. Constitution is the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in
force today.[84] Going into force in 1789, it reorganized the government into a federation administered by three branches
(executive, judicial, and legislative), on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances. George Washington, who led
the Continental Army to victory in the Revolutionary War and then willingly relinquished power, was elected the new
nation's first President under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and
guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.[85]
During the British Colonial era, slavery was legal in the American colonies, a longstanding institution in world history, and
"challenges to its moral legitimacy were rare". However, during the Revolution, many in the colonies began to question the
practice.[86] Regional divisions over slavery grew in the ensuing decades. In the North, several prominent Founding Fathers
such as John Adams, Roger Sherman, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and Benjamin Franklin advocated for the abolition of
slavery, and by the 1810s every state in the region had, with these emancipations being the first in the Atlantic World.

In the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand further westward, some of
them with a sense of manifest destiny.
[88][89] The Louisiana Purchase (1803) nearly
doubled the acreage of the United States, effectively ending French colonial interest in
North America and their opposition to American westward expansion. [90] Spain ceded
Florida and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819,[91] The Missouri Compromise (1820)
admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state and declared a policy of
prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands north of the 36°30′
parallel. The outcome de facto sectionalized the country into two factions: free states,
which forbade slavery; and slave states, which protected the institution; it was
controversial, widely seen as dividing the country along sectarian lines.[92] Although the
national government outlawed American participation in the Atlantic slave trade in 1807,
after 1820 cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South,
and along with it the use of slave labor.
[93][94][95] In the South, the invention of the
cotton gin lowering the cost of cotton production and exponentially increasing profits spurred the entrenchment of slavery,
with regional elites and intellectuals increasingly viewing the institution as a positive good instead of a necessary evil.
[96] The
Second Great Awakening, especially in the period 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North,
it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism;
[97] in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized
among slave populations.[98]
As it expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian
removal or assimilation.
[99][100] The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that forcibly resettled
Indians. The displacement prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River[101] and eventually
conflict with Mexico.[102] Most of these conflicts ended with the cession of Native American territory and their confinement
to Indian reservations.
The Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845 during a period of expansionism,[89] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led
to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.
[103] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848
Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest, with the U.S. now spanning the
continent.[88][104] The California Gold Rush of 1848–1849 spurred migration to the Pacific coast, which led to the California
genocide[105] and the creation of additional western states.[106]
Irreconcilable sectional conflict regarding the enslavement of those of black African
descent[107] was the primary cause of the American Civil War.
[108] With the 1860
election of Republican Abraham Lincoln, conventions in eleven slave states, all in the
Southern United States, declared secession and formed the Confederate States of
America, while the remaining states, known as the Union, maintained that secession was
unconstitutional and illegitimate.
[109] On April 12, 1861, the Confederacy initiated
military conflict by bombarding Fort Sumter, a federal garrison in Charleston harbor in
South Carolina.
The American Civil War, the deadliest military conflict in American history, ensued and
was fought between 1861 and 1865. The war resulted in the deaths of approximately
620 000 soldiers from both sides and upwards of 50 000 civilians, most of them in the
South.[110] In early July 1863, the Civil War began to turn in the Union's favor following
the Union Army under General Ulysses S. Grant successfully splitting the Confederacy in
two by capturing Vicksburg in the west, denying it any further movement along or across
the Mississippi River and preventing supplies from Texas and Arkansas that might sustain the war effort from passing east,
almost simultaneous with victory in the Battle of Gettysburg, where Union Army general George Meade halted Confederate
Army general Robert E. Lee's invasion of the North. In April 1865, following the Union Army's victory at the Battle of
Appomattox Court House, the Confederacy surrendered and soon collapsed.
Reconstruction began in earnest following the defeat of the Confederates. While President Lincoln attempted to foster
reconciliation between the Union and former Confederacy, his assassination on April 14, 1865 drove a wedge between North
and South again. "Radical Republicans" in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South
and to ensure the rights of African Americans, and the so-called Reconstruction Amendments to the Constitution guaranteed
the abolishment of slavery, full citizenship to Americans of African descent, and suffrage for adult Black men. They persisted
until the Compromise of 1877.
Influential Southern Whites, calling themselves "Redeemers",[111] took local control of the South after the end of
Reconstruction, leading to the nadir of American race relations. From 1890 to 1910, the Redeemers established so-called Jim
Crow laws, disenfranchising almost all Blacks and some impoverished Whites throughout the region. Blacks faced racial

segregation nationwide, especially in the South,[112] and lived under the threat of lynching and other vigilante

National infrastructure, including telegraph and transcontinental railroads, spurred economic growth and greater settlement
and development of the American Old West. After the end of the American Civil War in 1865, new transcontinental railways
made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade, and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[115] Mainland
expansion also included the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.[116] In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii
overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S. annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam,
and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, by the Treaty of Paris (1898) following the Spanish–American
War.
[117] Puerto Ricans did not gain citizenship either through the Foraker Act (1900) or the Insular Cases (1901), but only
one month prior to American entry into World War I though the Jones–Shafroth Act in 1917.[118]:60–63 American Samoa was
acquired by the United States in 1900 after the end of the Second Samoan Civil War.
[119] The U.S. Virgin Islands were
purchased from Denmark in 1917.[120]
From 1865 through 1918 an unprecedented and diverse stream of immigrants arrived in
the United States, 27.5 million in total. In all, 24.4 million (89%) came from Europe,
including 2.9 million from Great Britain, 2.2 million from Ireland, 2.1 million from
Scandinavia, 3.8 million from Germany, 4.1 million from Italy, 7.8 million from Russia
and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe. Another 1.7 million came from
Canada.
[123] Most came through the port of New York City, and from 1892, through the
immigration station on Ellis Island, but various ethnic groups settled in different
locations. New York and other large cities of the East Coast became home to large
Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans
moved to the Midwest, obtaining jobs in industry and mining. At the same time, about
one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.
[124] The Great
Migration, which began around 1910, resulted in millions of African Americans leaving
the rural South for urban areas in the North.[125]
Rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the
rise of many prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of "trusts" and
monoplies to prevent competition.[126] Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D.
Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation's expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking
became a major part of the economy, with J. P. Morgan playing a notable role. The United States also emerged as a pioneer of
the automotive industry in the early 20th century.[127] These changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic
inequality, immigration, and social unrest, which prompted the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist
movements.[128][129][130] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by
significant reforms, including health and safety regulation of consumer goods, the rise of labor unions, greater antitrust
measures to ensure competition among businesses, and improvements in worker conditions.[131]
The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I in 1914 until 1917
when it joined the war as an "associated power" alongside the Allies of World War I,
helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson
took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference and advocated strongly for
the U.S. to join the League of Nations. However, the U.S. Senate refused to support this
and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles under which the League of Nations was
established.[132] In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women's
suffrage.
[133]
During the 1920s and 1930s, radio for mass communication and ultimately the invention
of early television transformed communications in the United States.[134] The prosperity
of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the
Great Depression. After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt, between
1933 and 1939, introduced his New Deal social and economic policies, which included
public works projects, financial reforms, and regulations which represented a shift to a
new current of modern liberalism in the United States".[135] The Dust Bowl of the mid1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.[136]
At first neutral during World War II, the United States began supplying war materiel to the Allies in March 1941. A total of
$50.1 billion (equivalent to $719  billion in 2021) worth of supplies was shipped in 1941–1945, or 17% of the total war
expenditures of the U.S.[137] On December  7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor,
prompting the United States to militarily join the Allies against the Axis powers, and in the following year, to intern about
120 000 Japanese and Japanese Americans.[138][139] The U.S. pursued a "Europe first" defense policy,[140] with the
Philippines being invaded and occupied by Japan until the country's liberation by the U.S.-led forces in 1944–1945. During

the war, the United States was one of the "Four Policemen"
[141] who met to plan the
postwar world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union, and China.[142][143] The United
States emerged relatively unscathed from the war, and with even greater economic and
military influence.[144]
The United States played a leading role in the Bretton Woods and Yalta conferences,
during which agreements were signed on new international financial institutions and
Europe's postwar reorganization. As an Allied victory was achieved in Europe, a 1945
international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter,
which became active after the war.[145] The United States developed the first nuclear
weapons and used them against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August
1945; the Japanese subsequently surrendered on September 2, ending World War
II.
[146][147]
After World War II, the United States launched the Marshall Plan to aid war-torn Europe, providing $13 billion ($115 billion
in 2021)[148] for reconstruction. This period also marked the beginning of the Cold War, with geopolitical tensions between
the U.S. and the Soviet Union driven by ideological differences.[149] The two countries led military affairs of Europe, with the
U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact satellite states on the other. The U.S. engaged
in regime change operations against left-wing governments, conflicts like the Korean and Vietnam Wars and led the Space
Race, eventually landing people on the Moon in 1969.
[150][151][152][153][154] Domestically, the United States experienced
economic growth, urbanization, and a rapid growth of its population following World War II. The construction of an
Interstate Highway System transformed the nation's transportation infrastructure,[155][156] and Alaska and Hawaii were
admitted as states, expanding the country's borders.[157]
The civil rights movement emerged, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent
leader in the early 1960s.[158] President Lyndon B. Johnson initiated the "Great Society",
introducing sweeping legislation and policies to address poverty and racial
inequalities.[159] The counterculture movement in the U.S. brought significant social
changes, including the liberalization of attitudes towards what substances are acceptable
for recreational drug use, sexuality[160][161] and the beginning of the modern gay rights
movement as well as open defiance of the military draft and opposition to intervention in
Vietnam.
[162]
The United States supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War, leading to the 1973 oil
crisis. The presidency of Richard Nixon saw the American withdrawal from Vietnam but
also the Watergate scandal, which led to his resignation and a decline in public trust of
government that expanded for decades.[163] After a surge in female labor participation
around the 1970s, by 1985, the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[164]
The 1970s and early 1980s saw economic stagflation and President Ronald Reagan
responded with neoliberal reforms and a rollback strategy towards the Soviet Union.[165][166][167][168] The late 1980s and
early 1990s saw the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold
War and solidified the U.S. as the world's sole superpower.[169][170][171][172]
In the first decades of the 21st century, the U.S. faced challenges from terrorism, with the
September 11 attacks leading to the war on terror and military interventions in
Afghanistan and Iraq.
[173][174]
Government policy designed to promote affordable housing,[175] widespread failures in
corporate and regulatory governance,[176] and historically low interest rates set by the
Federal Reserve[177] led to a housing bubble in 2006. This culminated in the financial
crisis of 2007–2008 and the Great Recession, the nation's largest economic contraction
since the Great Depression.[178] Barack Obama, the first multiracial[179] President with
African ancestry, was elected in 2008 amid the financial crisis.[180] By the end of his
second term, the stock market, median household income and net worth, and the
number of persons with jobs were all at record levels, while the unemployment rate was
well below the historical average.[181][182][183][184][185]
The U.S. also faced social debates on issues such as abortion access, same-sex marriage, mass shootings, police brutality,
lingering institutional racism, climate change policy, media bias and immigration that brought significant policy changes and
political polarization. The attack on the United States Capitol of January 6, 2021 attempting to prevent the peaceful

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 100 million confirmed cases and 1 million deaths in the United States as of
2023;[188] it is the most deadly pandemic in U.S. history.
[189]
The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of
3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470  km2
). Of this area, 2,959,064 square miles
(7,663,940 km2
) is contiguous land, composing 83.65% of total U.S. land area.[190][191]
About 15% is occupied by Alaska, a state in northwestern North America, with the
remainder in Hawaii, a state and archipelago in the central Pacific, and the five
populated but unincorporated insular territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam,
the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
[192] Measured by only land
area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, and just ahead of
Canada.[193] The United States is the world's third-largest nation by land and total area
behind Russia and Canada.

The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests
and the rolling hills of the Piedmont.
[195] The Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack massif divide the eastern seaboard
from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.
[196] The Mississippi–Missouri River, the world's fourth longest river
system, runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the
west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[196]
The Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet
(4,300  m) in Colorado.
[197] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua, Sonoran, and
Mojave.
[198] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges also reaching
altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of
California,[199] and only about 84 miles (135 km) apart.[200] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali is the
highest peak in the country and in North America.[201] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and
Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the
Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[202]
With its large size and geographic variety, the United States includes most climate types.
To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the
north to humid subtropical in the south.[203]
The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Many mountainous areas of
the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert
in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and
Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the
southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the
Pacific.[204]
States bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's
tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and
South.[205] Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather
incidents than any other country in the world.[206]
Extreme weather became more frequent in the U.S. in the 21st century, with three times
the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s. Of the ten warmest years ever recorded in the 48 contiguous states, eight
occurred after 1998. In the American Southwest, droughts became more persistent and more severe.[207]
The U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species: about 17 000 species of vascular
plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and more than 1800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii,
few of which occur on the mainland.[209] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, and 295
amphibians,
[210] and 91 000 insect species.[211]

There are 63 national parks, which are managed by the National Park Service, and
hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas, managed by
the National Park Service and other agencies.[212] Altogether, about 28% of the country's
land area is publicly owned and federally managed,[213] primarily located in the western
states.
[214] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for oil and gas drilling,
mining, logging, or cattle ranching, and less than one percent of it is used for military
purposes.[215][216]
Environmental issues in the United States include debates on non-renewable resources
and nuclear energy, air and water pollution, biological diversity, logging and
deforestation,
[217][218] and climate change.
[219][220] The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970, is the federal agency charged with
enforcing and addressing most environmental-related issues.
[221] The idea of wilderness
has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.
[222] The
Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are
monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
[223]
As of 2020, the U.S. ranked 24th among 180 nations in the Environmental Performance Index.
[224] The country joined the
Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016, and has many other environmental commitments.[225] It withdrew from the
Paris Agreement in 2020[226] but rejoined it in 2021.[227]
The United States was founded on the principles of the American Enlightenment. It is a
federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and several uninhabited
island possessions.
[228][229][230] It is the world's oldest surviving federation, and,
according to the World Economic Forum, the oldest democracy as well.[231] It is a liberal
representative democracy "in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights
protected by law."[232]
Major democracy indexes uniformly classify the country as a liberal democracy.[233] The
2022 Corruption Perceptions Index and Global Corruption Barometer rank the United
States as having low levels of both actual and perceived corruption,
[234][235] and human
rights rankings place the United States highly.[236][237][238]
The federal government comprises three branches, which are headquartered in
Washington, D.C. and regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the
Constitution.[239]
The U.S. Congress, a bicameral legislature, made up of the Senate and the House
of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the
power of the purse,
[240] and has the power of impeachment, by which it can remove
sitting members of the federal government.[241]
The U.S. President is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative
bills before they become law (subject to congressional override), and appoints the
members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who
administer and enforce federal laws and policies through their respective
agencies.
[242]
The U.S. Supreme Court and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by
the President with Senate approval, interpret laws and overturn those they find
unconstitutional.
[243]
The President serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than
twice. The President is not elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college
system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the District of
Columbia.[244] The Supreme Court, led by the chief justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life. They
are appointed by the sitting President when a vacancy becomes available.[245]
The U.S. Constitution serves as the country's supreme legal document, establishing the structure and responsibilities of the
federal government and its relationship with the individual states. The Constitution has been amended 27 times.[246]
Government and politics
The United Nations headquarters
has been situated along the East
River in Midtown Manhattan since
1952; in 1945, the United States
was a founding member of the UN.
The United States has operated under an uncodified informal two-party system for most of its history, although other parties
have run candidates.
[247] What the two major parties are has changed over time: the Republicans and Democrats presently
are the two major parties, and the country is currently in either the Fifth or Sixth Party System.
[248]
In the American federal system, sovereignty is shared between two levels of government: federal and state. People in the
states are also governed by local governments, which are administrative divisions of the states. The territories and the
District of Columbia are administrative divisions of the federal government. Governance on many issues is decentralized.
[249]
Each of the 50 states has territory where it shares sovereignty with the federal government. States are subdivided into
counties or county equivalents, and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that
contains the capital of the United States, the city of Washington.
[250] Each state is entitled to presidential electors whose
number equals the number of their representatives and senators in Congress, and the District of Columbia has three
electors.[251] Territories of the United States do not have presidential electors, therefore people there cannot vote for the
president.[252]
United States citizenship is granted to those born in the 50 states, Washington, D.C., or any of the U.S. territories except
American Samoa.
[m][256][253] Foreign-born persons who are not yet US citizens may acquire citizenship through the process
of naturalization, according to the requirements of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).[257] Naturalized
citizens have the same rights as those who became citizens at birth.[257]
The United States observes limited tribal sovereignty for American Indian nations. American Indians are U.S. citizens and
tribal lands are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states, tribes have some
restrictions on their autonomy. They are prohibited from making war, engaging in foreign relations, and printing or issuing
their own currency.[258] Indian reservations are usually contained within one particular state, but there are 12 reservations
that cross state boundaries.[259]
The United States has an established structure of foreign relations, and it had the world's
second-largest diplomatic corps in 2019.[260] It is a permanent member of the United
Nations Security Council,
[261] and home to the United Nations headquarters.
[262] The
United States is also a member of the G7,
[263] G20,
[264] and OECD intergovernmental
organizations.[265] Almost all countries have embassies and many have consulates
(official representatives) in the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host formal
diplomatic missions with the United States, except Iran,
[266] North Korea,
[267] and
Bhutan.
[268] Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it
maintains close, if unofficial, relations.[269] The United States also regularly supplies
Taiwan with military equipment to deter potential Chinese aggression.[270]

The United States has a "Special Relationship" with the United Kingdom[271] and strong ties with Canada,
[272] Australia,
[273]
New Zealand,
[274] the Philippines,
[275] Japan,
[276] South Korea,
[277] Israel,
[278] and several European Union countries
(France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Poland).[279] The U.S. works closely with its NATO allies on military and national
security issues, and with nations in the Americas through the Organization of American States and the United States–
Mexico–Canada Free Trade Agreement. In South America, Colombia is traditionally considered to be the closest ally of the
United States.[280] The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall
Islands, and Palau through the Compact of Free Association.
[281] It has increasingly conducted strategic cooperation with
India,
[282] and its ties with China have steadily deteriorated.[283][284] The U.S. has become a key ally of Ukraine since Russia
annexed Crimea in 2014 and began an invasion of Ukraine in 2022, significantly deteriorating relations with Russia in the
process.[285][286]
The President is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and
appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The
Department of Defense, which is headquartered at the Pentagon near Washington, D.C.,
administers five of the six service branches, which are made up of the Army, Marine
Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force. The Coast Guard is administered by the
Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and can be transferred to the
Department of the Navy in wartime.[287] The United States spent $877 billion on its
military in 2022, 39% of global military spending, accounting for 3.5% of the country's
GDP.[288][289] The U.S. has more than 40% of the world's nuclear weapons, the secondlargest amount after Russia.[290]
In 2019, all six branches of the U.S. Armed Forces reported 1.4  million personnel on
active duty.[291] The Reserves and National Guard brought the total number of troops to
2.3 million.[291] The Department of Defense also employed about 700 000 civilians, not
including contractors.
[292] Military service in the United States is voluntary, although
conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective Service System.
[293] The United
States has the third-largest combined armed forces in the world, behind the Chinese
People's Liberation Army and Indian Armed Forces.
[294]
Today, American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force's large fleet of transport
aircraft, the Navy's 11 active aircraft carriers, and Marine expeditionary units at sea with
the Navy, and Army's XVIII Airborne Corps and 75th Ranger Regiment deployed by Air
Force transport aircraft. The Air Force can strike targets across the globe through its fleet
of strategic bombers, maintains the air defense across the United States, and provides
close air support to Army and Marine Corps ground forces.[295][296]
The Space Force operates the Global Positioning System (GPS, also widespread in
civilian use worldwide), the Eastern and Western Ranges for all space launches, and the United States's Space Surveillance
and Missile Warning networks.[297][298][299] The military operates about 800 bases and facilities abroad,[300] and maintains
deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[301]
There are about 18 000 U.S. police agencies from local to federal level in the United
States.[302] Law in the United States is mainly enforced by local police departments and
sheriff's offices in their municipal or county jurisdictions. The state police departments
have authority in their respective state, and federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have national jurisdiction and
specialized duties, such as protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S.
federal courts' rulings and federal laws.[303] State courts conduct most civil and criminal
trials,[304] and federal courts handle designated crimes and appeals from the state
criminal courts.[305]
As of 2020, the United States has an intentional homicide rate of 7 per 100 000 people.[306] A cross-sectional analysis of the
World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States homicide rates "were 7.0 times higher
than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher."[307]
As of January 2023, the United States has the sixth highest per-capita incarceration rate in the world, at 531 people per
100 000; and the largest prison and jail population in the world at 1 767 200.
[308][309] In 2019, the total prison population
for those sentenced to more than a year was 1 430 000, corresponding to a ratio of 419 per 100 000 residents and the lowest

since 1995.[310] Some think tanks place that number higher, such as Prison Policy Initiative's estimate of 1.9 million.[311]
Various states have attempted to reduce their prison populations via government policies and grassroots initiatives.[312]
According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) is
$25.5 trillion, the largest of any country in the world, constituting over 25% of the gross
world product at market exchange rates and over 15% of the gross world product at
purchasing power parity (PPP).[315][13] From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded
annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the
Group of Seven.
[316] The country ranks first in the world by nominal GDP,
[317] second by
GDP (PPP),
[13] seventh by nominal GDP per capita,
[315] and eighth by GDP (PPP) per
capita.
[13] As of 2022, the United States was ranked 25th out of 169 countries on the
Social Progress Index, which measures "the extent to which countries provide for the
social and environmental needs of their citizens."[318] The U.S. has been the world's
largest economy since at least 1900.[319]
Many of the world's largest companies, such as Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple,
AT&T, Coca-Cola, Disney, General Motors, McDonald's, Meta, Microsoft, Nike, Pepsi,
and Walmart, were founded and are headquartered in the United States.[321] Of the
world's 500 largest companies, 136 are headquartered in the U.S.[321]
The United States is at or near the forefront of technological advancement and
innovation[322] in many economic fields, especially in artificial intelligence; computers;
pharmaceuticals; and medical, aerospace and military equipment.
[323] The nation's
economy is fueled by abundant natural resources, a well-developed infrastructure, and
high productivity.
[324] It has the second-highest total-estimated value of natural
resources, valued at US$44.98 trillion in 2019, although sources differ on their estimates.
Americans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD
member states,[325] and the fourth-highest median household income,
[326] up from
sixth-highest in 2013.[327]
The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and is the world's
foremost reserve currency, backed by the country's dominant economy, its military, the
petrodollar system, and its linked eurodollar and large U.S. treasuries market.
[313]
Several countries use it as their official currency and in others it is the de facto
currency.
[328][329] New York City is the world's principal financial center, with the
largest economic output, and the epicenter of the principal American metropolitan
economy.[330][331][332] The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, both located in New
York City, are the world's two largest stock exchanges by market capitalization and trade
volume.
[333][334]
The largest U.S. trading partners are the European Union, Mexico, Canada, China,
Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, India, and Taiwan.
[335] The United
States is the world's largest importer and the second-largest exporter after China.[336] It is by far the world's largest exporter
of services.
[337] It has free trade agreements with several countries, including the USMCA.
[338] The U.S. ranked second in the
Global Competitiveness Report in 2019, after Singapore.
[339]
While its economy has reached a post-industrial level of development, the United States remains an industrial power.
[340] As
of 2018, the U.S. is the second-largest manufacturing nation after China.[341] Despite the fact that the U.S. only accounted for
4.24% of the global population, residents of the U.S. collectively possessed 31.5% of the world's total wealth as of 2021, the
largest percentage of any country.[342] The U.S. also ranks first in the number of dollar billionaires and millionaires, with 724
billionaires[343] and nearly 22 million millionaires (as of 2021).[344]
Wealth in the United States is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population own 72% of the country's
household wealth, while the bottom 50% own just 2%.[345] Income inequality in the U.S. remains at record highs,[346] with
the top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all income[347] and giving the U.S. one of the widest income
distributions among OECD members.[348] There were about 582,500 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S.
in 2022, with 60% staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program.[349] In 2018 six million children
experience food insecurity.[350] Feeding America estimates that around one in seven, or approximately 11 million, children
experience hunger and do not know where they will get their next meal or when.[351] As of June 2018, 40 million people,
roughly 12.7% of the U.S. population, were living in poverty, including 13.3 million children.[352]

The United States has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than most other highincome countries.[353][354] It is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation nationally[355]
and is one of a few countries in the world without federal paid family leave as a legal right.[356] The United States also has a
higher percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed nation, largely because of a weak collective
bargaining system and lack of government support for at-risk workers.[357]
The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th
century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing
interchangeable parts and the establishment of a machine tool industry enabled the U.S.
to have large-scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles, and other items in the
late 19th century. In the early 20th century, factory electrification, the introduction of the
assembly line, and other labor-saving techniques created the system of mass
production.
[358] In the 21st century, approximately two-thirds of research and
development funding comes from the private sector.[359] In 2022, the United States was
the country with the second-highest number of published scientific papers.[360] As of
2021, the U.S. ranked second by the number of patent applications, and third by
trademark and industrial design applications.[361] In 2021, the United States launched a
total of 51 spaceflights.
[362] The U.S. had 2,944 active satellites in space in December
2021, the highest number of any country.[363] In 2022, the United States ranked 2nd in
the Global Innovation Index.
[364]
As of 2021, the United States receives approximately 79.1% of its energy from fossil
fuels.[365] In 2021, the largest source of the country's energy came from petroleum (36.1%), followed by natural gas (32.2%),
coal (10.8%), renewable sources (12.5%), and nuclear power (8.4%).[365] The United States constitutes less than 5% of the
world's population, but consumes 17% of the world's energy.
[366] It accounts for about 20% of both the world's annual
petroleum consumption and petroleum supply.[367] The U.S. ranks as second-highest emitter of greenhouse gases, exceeded
only by China.[368]
The United States's rail network, nearly all standard gauge, is the longest in the world,
and exceeds 293,564  km (182,400 mi).[370] It handles mostly freight, with intercity
passenger service primarily provided by Amtrak, a government-managed company that
took over services previously run by private companies, to all but four states.[371][372]
Personal transportation in the United States is dominated by automobiles,
[373][374]
which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of public roads,
making it the longest network in the world.[375][376] The Oldsmobile Curved Dash and
the Ford Model T, both American cars, are considered the first mass-produced[377] and
mass-affordable[378] cars, respectively. As of 2022, the United States is the secondlargest manufacturer of motor vehicles[379] and is home to Tesla, the world's most
valuable car company.[380] American automotive company General Motors held the title
of the world's best-selling automaker from 1931 to 2008.[381] Currently, the American
automotive industry is the world's second-largest automobile market by sales,[382] and
the U.S. has the highest vehicle ownership per capita in the world, with 816.4 vehicles per 1000 Americans (2014).[383] In
2017, there were 255 million non-two wheel motor vehicles, or about 910 vehicles per 1000 people.[384]
The American civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major
airports are publicly owned.[385] The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American
Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.
[386] Of the world's 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in
the United States, including the top five and the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.
[387][388] As of
2020, there are 19,919 airports in the United States, of which 5,217 are designated as "public use", including for general
aviation and other activities.[389]

The country's inland waterways are the world's fifth-longest, and total 41,009 km (25,482 mi).[391]
The U.S. Census Bureau reported 331,449,281 residents as of April 1, 2020,[n][392]
making the United States the third-most populous nation in the world, after China and
India.[393] According to the Bureau's U.S. Population Clock, on January  28, 2021, the
U.S. population had a net gain of one person every 100 seconds, or about 864 people per
day.[394] In 2018, 52% of Americans age 15 and over were married, 6% were widowed,
10% were divorced, and 32% had never been married.[395] In 2021, the total fertility rate
for the U.S. stood at 1.7 children per woman,[396] and it had the world's highest rate of
children (23%) living in single-parent households in 2019.[397]
The United States has a diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one
million members.[398] White Americans with ancestry from Europe, the Middle East or
North Africa, form the largest racial and ethnic group at 57.8% of the United States
population.[399][400] Hispanic and Latino Americans form the second-largest group and
are 18.7% of the United States population. African Americans constitute the nation's third-largest ancestry group and are
12.1% of the total United States population.[398] Asian Americans are the country's fourth-largest group, composing 5.9% of
the United States population, while the country's 3.7 million Native Americans account for about 1%.[398] In 2020, the
median age of the United States population was 38.5 years.[393]
While many languages are spoken in the United States, English is the most common.[401]
Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S.
naturalization requirements—standardize English, and most states have declared English
as the official language.[402] Three states and four U.S. territories have recognized local
or indigenous languages in addition to English, including Hawaii (Hawaiian),[403] Alaska
(twenty Native languages),[o][404] South Dakota (Sioux),[405] American Samoa
(Samoan), Puerto Rico (Spanish), Guam (Chamorro), and the Northern Mariana Islands
(Carolinian and Chamorro). In Puerto Rico, Spanish is more widely spoken than
English.[406]
According to the American Community Survey, in 2010 some 229 million people (out of
the total U.S. population of 308 million) spoke only English at home. More than 37
million spoke Spanish at home, making it the second most commonly used language.
Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (2.8
million), Tagalog (1.6 million), Vietnamese (1.4 million), French (1.3 million), Korean (1.1 million), and German (1
million).[407]
The United States has by far the highest number of immigrant population in the world, with 50,661,149 people.[408][409] In
2022, there were 87.7 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for nearly
27% of the overall U.S. population.[410] In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7  million) were
naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents,
and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants.[411] In 2019, the top countries of origin for immigrants were Mexico
(24% of immigrants), India (6%), China (5%), the Philippines (4.5%), and El Salvador (3%).[412] The United States led the
world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.[413]
Religious affiliation in the United States is among the most diverse in the
world[415] and varies significantly by region[416] and age.[417]

[418][419] The country
has the world's largest Christian population[420] and a majority of Americans
identify as Christian, predominately Catholic, mainline Protestant, or
evangelical. According to Gallup in the early 2020s, 58% and 17% reporting
praying often or sometimes, respectively, 46% and 26% reporting that religion
plays a very important or fairly important role, respectively, in their lives.[421]
Most Americans do not regularly attend religious services[414] and have low
confidence in religious institutions.[422]
Surveys conducted since 2020 indicate that between 74% and 91% of
Americans believe in either a higher power or a monotheistic god.[423][424]
Another 2022 Gallup poll found that 31% reported "attending a church, synagogue, mosque or temple weekly or nearly
weekly".[425] In the "Bible Belt", located within the Southern United States, evangelical Protestantism plays a significant role
culturally. New England and the Western United States tend to be less religious.
[416] Around 6% of Americans claim a nonChristian faith;[426] the largest of which are Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism.
[427] The United States either has the
first or second-largest Jewish population in the world, the largest outside of Israel.
[428] "Ceremonial deism" is common in
American culture.[418][429]
Until the 1990s, the country was an outlier among highly developed countries, having a high level of religiosity and wealth,
although this has lessened, with "sharp declines in church attendance, confidence in organized religion and religious
identification..." since then.[423][426][430] Around 30-33% of Americans describe themselves as having no religion,
[426][431]
with some retaining some beliefs and practices.[432] Membership in a house of worship fell from 70% in 1999 to 47% in
2020.[433]
About 82% of Americans live in urban areas, including suburbs;[194] about half of those reside in cities with populations over
50 000.
[434] In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100 000, nine cities had more than one million
residents, and four cities (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston) had populations exceeding two million.[435]

American public education is operated by state and local governments and regulated by the United States Department of
Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of five or
six (beginning with kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of

high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[437] Of Americans 25
and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2%
earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[438] The basic literacy
rate is approximately 99%.[194][439]
The United States has many private and public institutions of higher education. There
are local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter
academic programs, and lower tuition.[440] The U.S. spends more on education per
student than any nation in the world,[441] spending an average of $12,794 per year on
public elementary and secondary school students in the 2016–2017 school year.[442] As
for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the
OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[443]
Despite some student loan forgiveness programs in place,[444] student loan debt has
increased by 102% in the last decade,[445] and exceeded 1.7  trillion dollars as of
2022.[446]
The large majority of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States,
including 19 of the top 25.[447][448][449][450] The country has by far the most Nobel Prize winners in history, with 403 (having
won 406 awards).[451]
In a preliminary report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
announced that U.S. life expectancy at birth had dropped to 76.4 years in 2021 (73.2
years for men and 79.1 years for women), down 0.9 years from 2020. This was the
second year of overall decline, and the chief causes listed were the COVID-19 pandemic,
accidents, drug overdoses, heart and liver disease, and suicides.[453][454] Life expectancy
was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among Blacks and American
Indian–Alaskan Native (AIAN) peoples.
[455][456] Starting in 1998, the life expectancy in
the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' "health
disadvantage" gap has been increasing ever since.[457] The U.S. also has one of the
highest suicide rates among high-income countries,
[458] which reached record levels in
2022.[459] Approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and another
third is overweight.[460] According to CDC data, mortality rates among children and
adolescents increased by 20% from 2019 to 2021.[461][462] Poverty is the 4th leading risk
factor for premature death in the United States annually, according to a 2023 study
published in JAMA.
[463][464]
In 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic collisions caused
the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the
most years lost to disability. The most harmful risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure,
high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol consumption. Alzheimer's disease, substance use disorders, kidney disease,
cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.[465] Teenage
pregnancy and abortion rates in the U.S. are substantially higher than in other Western nations, especially among Blacks and
Hispanics.[466]
The U.S. health care system far outspends that of any other nation, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage
of GDP but attains worse health care outcomes when compared to peer nations.[467] The United States is the only developed
nation without a system of universal health care, and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health
insurance.
[468]
Government-funded health care coverage for the poor (Medicaid, established in 1965) and for those age 65 and older
(Medicare, begun in 1966) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. In 2010, former
President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA,[p][469] with the law roughly halving the
uninsured share of the population according to the CDC.[470] Multiple studies have concluded that ACA had reduced the
mortality of enrollees.[471][472][473] However, its legacy remains controversial.

Americans have traditionally been characterized by a unifying belief in an "American creed" emphasizing liberty, equality
under the law, democracy, social equality, property rights, and a preference for limited government.

highest in the world by a large margin.[485] The United States is home to a wide variety of ethnic
groups, traditions, and values,[486][487] and exerts major cultural influence on a global
scale,[488][489] with the phenomenon being termed Americanization.
[490] As such, the U.S. is
considered a cultural superpower.
[491]
Nearly all present Americans or their ancestors came from Eurafrasia ("the Old World") within
the past five centuries.[492] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived
from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as
traditions brought by slaves from Africa.
[486][493] More recent immigration from Asia and
especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing
melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl, with immigrants contributing to, and often
assimilating into, mainstream American culture.[486] The American Dream, or the perception
that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[494]
Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[495][496][497] While mainstream
culture holds that the United States is a classless society,
[498] scholars identify significant
differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and
values.[499] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or
average is promoted by some as a noble condition as well.[500]
The United States is considered to have the strongest protections of free speech of any country
in the world under the First Amendment,
[501] with the Supreme Court ruling that flag
desecration, hate speech, blasphemy, and lese-majesty are all forms of protected expression.[502][503][504] A 2016 Pew
Research Center poll found that Americans were the most supportive of free expression of any polity measured.[505] They are
also the "most supportive of freedom of the press and the right to use the Internet without government censorship."[506] It is
a socially progressive country[507] with permissive attitudes surrounding human sexuality.
[508] LGBT rights in the United
States are among the most advanced in the world.[508][509][510]
The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC),
Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox
Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial
entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[511] As of
2021, about 83% of Americans over age 12 listen to broadcast radio, while about 41% listen to
podcasts.
[512] As of September 30, 2014, there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in
the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[513] Much of the
public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR, incorporated in February 1970 under the Public
Broadcasting Act of 1967.
[514]
Globally-recognized newspapers in the United States include The Wall Street Journal, The New
York Times, The Washington Post, and USA Today.
[515] More than 800 publications are
produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind
English.[516][517] With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned,
either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of
newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or, in a situation that is increasingly
rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have alternative newspapers to complement
the mainstream daily papers, such as The Village Voice in New York City and LA Weekly in Los
Angeles. The five most popular websites used in the U.S. are Google, YouTube, Amazon, Yahoo, and Facebook, with all of
them being American companies.[518]
The video game market of the United States is the world's second-largest by revenue.[519] Major publishers headquartered in
the United States are Sony Interactive Entertainment, Take-Two, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Xbox Game Studios,
Bethesda Softworks, Epic Games, Valve, Warner Bros., Riot Games, and others.[520][521] There are 444 publishers,
developers, and hardware companies in California alone.[522]
In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of their cues from Europe. Writers such as
Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American
literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's
second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is recognized as an essential American poet.[524]

In the 1920s, the New Negro Movement coalesced in Harlem, where many writers had migrated
from the South and West Indies. Its pan-African perspective was a significant cultural export
during the Jazz Age in Paris and as such was a key early influence on the négritude
philosophy.[525]
Since its first use in the 19th century, the term "Great American Novel" has been applied to
many books, including Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851), Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle
Tom's Cabin (1852), Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's
The Great Gatsby (1925), John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath (1939), Harper Lee's To Kill a
Mockingbird (1960), Toni Morrison's Beloved (1987), and David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest
(1996).[526][527][528]
Thirteen U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Louise Glück, Bob
Dylan, and Toni Morrison.[529] Earlier laureates William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and
John Steinbeck have also been recognized as influential 20th century writers.[530]
In the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition
of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European
modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[531] Georgia O'Keeffe,
Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles, which would
become known as American modernism.
Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of
Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. Major photographers include Alfred Stieglitz,
Edward Steichen, Dorothea Lange, Edward Weston, James Van Der Zee, Ansel Adams, and Gordon Parks.
[532]
The uniquely American "Chicago School" refers to two architectural styles derived from the architecture of Chicago. In the
history of architecture, the first Chicago School was a school of architects active in Chicago in the late 19th, and at the turn of
the 20th century. They were among the first to promote the new technologies of steel-frame construction in commercial
buildings, and developed a spatial aesthetic which co-evolved with, and then came to influence, parallel developments in
European modernism. Much of its early work is also known as "Commercial Style".[533] A "Second Chicago School" with a
modernist aesthetic emerged in the 1940s through 1970s, which pioneered new building technologies and structural systems,
such as the tube-frame structure.
[534] The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought global fame to American
architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.
[535] Other Americans who have had dramatic
influences on national and international architecture include Maya Lin, Frederick Law Olmstead, I.M. Pei, and Stanford
White.
The United States movie industry has a worldwide influence and following. Hollywood, a district in northern Los Angeles, the
nation's second-most populous city, is the leader in motion picture production and the most recognizable movie industry in
the world.[536][537][538] The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially
successful and most ticket-selling movies in the world.[539][540]
Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around
Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made
there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[541] The
Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[542] and the Golden Globe
Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[543]
Director D. W. Griffith's film adaptation of The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the
Ku Klux Klan was the first American blockbuster, earning the equivalent of $1.8 billion in
current dollars. The technical achievements of the film revolutionized film grammar,
while its subject matter caused both strident protest and a revitalization of the Klan.
[544]
Producer and entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie
merchandising.
[545] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American
Old West, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema
with location shooting. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the "Golden Age of
Hollywood", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[546] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn
Monroe becoming iconic figures.[547][548] In the 1970s, "New Hollywood" or the "Hollywood Renaissance"[549] was defined
by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.
[550]
The 21st century has been marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, and
Apple TV+, which came to rival traditional cinema.[551][552]

Mainstream theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced
by the British theater.
[553] The central hub of the American theater scene has been Manhattan, with its divisions of
Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway.
[554] Many movie and television stars have gotten their big break working in
New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that
produce their own seasons. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater also has an active
community theater culture.[555]
American folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as
traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music, or roots music. Many
traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations,
and sometimes trace back to such origins as the British Isles, Mainland Europe, or
Africa.
[556]
The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have significantly influenced
American music at large. The Smithsonian Institution states, "African-American
influences are so fundamental to American music that there would be no American music
without them."[557] One instrument first mass-produced in the United States was the
banjo, which had originally been crafted from gourds covered by animal skins by African
slaves.[558][559] Banjos became widely popular in the 19th century due to their use in
minstrel shows.
[558] Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elements from folk idioms
such as the blues and what is known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global
audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century.[560]
Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the pioneers of rock and roll in the mid-1950s. Rock bands such as Metallica, the
Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales.[561][562][563] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged
from the folk revival to become one of the country's most celebrated songwriters.[564] Mid-20th-century American pop stars
such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra,
[565] and Elvis Presley became global celebrities,[560] as have artists of the late 20th
century such as Prince, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey.
[566][567] The musical forms of
punk and hip hop both originated in the United States.[568] American professional opera singers have reached the highest
level of success in that form, including Renée Fleming, Leontyne Price, Beverly Sills, Nelson Eddy, and many others.[569]
American popular music, as part of the wider U.S. pop culture, has a worldwide influence and following.[570] Beyoncé, Taylor
Swift, Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande, Eminem, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, and many other contemporary artists dominate global
streaming rankings.
[571] The United States has the world's largest music market with a total retail value of $4.9 billion in
2014.[572] Most of the world's major record companies are based in the U.S.; they are represented by the Recording Industry
Association of America (RIAA).[573]
Early settlers were introduced by Native Americans to such indigenous, non-European
foods as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. Of the most enduring
and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash. Early settlers
and later immigrants combined these with foods they had known, such as wheat
flour,
[574] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[575][576] Homegrown
foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays,
Thanksgiving, when many Americans make or purchase traditional foods to celebrate the
occasion.[577]
The American fast food industry, the world's first and largest, is often viewed as being a
symbol of U.S. marketing dominance. Companies such as McDonald's,
[578] Burger King,
Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Domino's Pizza, among others, have numerous outlets around the world,[579] and
pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s.[580] Characteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken,
doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various
immigrants.[581][582] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are
widely consumed.[583]
American chefs have been influential both in the food industry and in popular culture. Some important 19th-century
American chefs include Charles Ranhofer of Delmonico's Restaurant in New York, and Bob Payton, who is credited with
bringing American-style pizza to the UK.[584] Later, chefs Charles Scotto, Louis Pacquet, John Massironi founded the
American Culinary Federation in 1930, taking after similar organizations across Europe. In the 1940s, Chef James Beard
hosted the first nationally televised cooking show I Love to Eat. His is the namesake for the foundation and it's prestigious
cooking award recognizing excellence in the American cooking community.[585][586] Since Beard, other chefs and cooking

personalities have taken to television, and the success of the Cooking Channel and Food
Network have contributed to the popularity of American cuisine. Probably the best-known
television chef was Julia Child who taught French cuisine in her weekly show, The French
Chef.
[587] In 1946, the Culinary Institute of America was founded by Katharine Angell and
Frances Roth. This would become the United States' most prestigious culinary school,
where many of the most talented American chefs would study prior to successful
careers.[588][589] The United States is home to over 220 Michelin Star rated restaurants, 70
of which are in New York City alone.[590]
The most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are
American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice
hockey, according to a 2017 Gallup poll.
[591] While most major U.S. sports such as
baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball,
volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which
have become popular worldwide.[592] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American
and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[593] The market for
professional sports in the United States was approximately $69  billion in July 2013,
roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[594]
American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United
States;[595] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of
any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions
globally.[596] Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th
century, with Major League Baseball being the top league. Basketball, soccer and ice
hockey are the country's next three most popular professional team sports, with the top
leagues being the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League, which are also the premier leagues
worldwide for these sports. The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR
and IndyCar.
[597][598] On the collegiate level, earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually,[599] and
college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA Final Four is one of the most watched national sporting
events.[600]
Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the
first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[601] The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los
Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,959 medals (1,173 gold) at the Olympic Games,
by far the most of any country.[602][603][604]
In international soccer, the men's national soccer team qualified for eleven World Cups, and the women's national team has
won the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each.[605] The United States hosted the 1994
FIFA World Cup and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.
